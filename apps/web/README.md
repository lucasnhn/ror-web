# ROR Web App

This is the web application for ROR (Release Operate Report), providing a dashboard for monitoring and managing Kubernetes clusters.

## Getting Started

1. Set up environment variables:

```bash
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
```

Edit the `.env.local` file with your configuration:
- `AUTH_SECRET`: Secret for signing authentication tokens
- `AUTH_ISSUER`: Your authentication issuer URL
- `AUTH_CLIENT_ID`: Client ID for authentication
- `AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`: Client secret for authentication
- `AUTH_AUDIENCE`: Authentication audience
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ROR_API_URL`: URL to the ROR API backend
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCKING_ENABLED`: Set to 'true' to enable MSW mocking during development

### Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Next.js development server at http://localhost:11100.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Project Structure

The ROR Web app follows a Next.js 15 App Router architecture:

```

```

### Key Directories and Files

- `__mocks__/`: Contains mock data and MSW handlers for development without a real backend
- `src/app/`: Next.js App
- `src/components/`: Reusable UI components separated by functionality
- `src/config/`: Configuration files for environment variables, authentication, and routes
- `src/features/`: Feature-based code organization for more complex features
- `src/services/`: External service integrations
- `src/utils/`: Utility functions for common operations across the app
